# Session: PR #11 Review — 2026-02-18

**Requested by:** dkirby-ms

## Who Worked
- **Alex** — Code review of PR #11
- **Drummer** — Test verification and fixes

## What They Did
- **Alex** found blocking issues: 122 test failures, debug console.log statements remain in code
- **Drummer** ran full test suite and fixed broken mocks to match implementation changes

## Decisions Made
- PR #11 (PixiJS Canvas Phase 1) rejected — tests must pass before merge
- Quality standard established: all new code must pass its own tests, not just preserve existing passage
- Reassigned to Naomi for cleanup and test fixes

## Key Outcomes
- Test failures traced to incomplete debug code removal and mock incompatibilities
- Canvas test suite fixes documented; fixes include SceneManager mock updates and Viewport assertions
- Clear merge gate established
